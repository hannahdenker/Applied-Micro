# Problem Set 1
Course: ECON 8848  
Author: Dan Mangan  
Date: <<dd_display: c(current_date)>>

## 1. Load and get to know the data

First, I will load the dataset into memory and produce an overview of its contents using the **describe** command.

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
use "${rawdatapath}acs2007.dta", clear 
describe
<</dd_do>>
~~~~  

This dataset <<dd_display: %12.0fc `r(N)'  >> has observations and <<dd_display: `r(k)'  >> variables. 

The formatting of the variables appears to be okay, though I would probabaly recode a couple of them: 
<ul>
<li>I would rename "sex" to be "female" and recode it as 0=male and 1=female.</li>
<li>Missingness in incwage seems to be coded as "99999" but should be ".".</li>
</ul>

Next, I summarize the dataset to examine each variable in more detail.

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
su 
<</dd_do>>
~~~~  

As noted above, there is strange coding for missigness in the incwage variable. Genreally
to find odd coding issues for missing values, we can check min and max values.

To find the range of **age**, we can summarize only that variable. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
su age
<</dd_do>>
~~~~  

We see here that the age variable ranges between <<dd_display: `r(min)'  >> and <<dd_display: `r(max)'  >> years.

## 2. Getting the sample right
