## RQ: Does smoking affect birthweight? 
It's helpful to understand that each observation in this dataset represents 
a newborn.

*******************************
*
*	1. Load Data & Variable Creation
*
*******************************
<</dd_remove>>

## 1. Getting Started 

In this section of code, I load the dataset and create a global to store key
variables I want to know more about. I also make two new analytic variables--
a dummy to represent whether or not the mother smoked, and a dummy to represent
whether or not the newborn's family's income was above the median income in this sample. 

I label these new variables and their values to keep their meanings clear in 
later analysis.

*	2. Creating Descriptive Tables
*
*******************************
<</dd_remove>>

## 2. Descriptive Statistics

We want to calculate descriptive statistics for variables that might
help us answer our research question. I am going to use the <code>tabstat</code>
command to make a table with the "mean, median, standard deviation, and 
number of valid observations" using the variables in the global "desc_vars" I created above.

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
tabstat $desc_vars, statistics(mean median sd count) format(%9.1g)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

**What do you notice in this table that you might want to report to your audience?**

The first thing I notice from the results is that we are missing about 200 observations 
in the variable "fatheduc", but only one observation in "motheduc". 

Next, I'm noticing that the mean and median are relatively close for the "bwght" variables, 
which makes me think that this variable is distributed normally. Relatedly, since the median 
of the "packs" variable is 0, we can assume that this variable would be positively-skewed.

While the previously mentioned points are important to me, the researcher, I'm not sure I would 
report them to my audience. Usually, we like to share demographics with our audience, so I think
making a table with the means of the "bwght", "male" and "white" variables would help our audience 
understand the newborns in this sample. 

I would also point out that most of the parents in this sample have at least a high school degree. 

It might be helpful to create a new table of descriptive statistics that 
separates smokers from the non-smokers in our sample. We will use the 
<code>by</code> option to accomplish this with the <code>tabstat</code> command. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
sort smoker
tabstat $desc_vars, c(s) statistics(mean median sd count) by(smoker) longstub format(%9.1g)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

**Are there substantial differences in the characteristics of smokers and non-smokers?**
<ul>
<li>There is a substantial difference in the number of observations between the two groups (about
1200 newborns were born to mothers who didn't smoke and about 200 newborns were born to mothers 
who did smoke).</li> 
<li>Parents that included a mother who smoked were slightly less likely to have graduated 
high school, and parents that included a mother who did not smoke were slightly more likely to have some 
education after high school.</li> 
<li>Importantly, the family income of parents that include non-smoking mothers is about $10,000 more
dollars than the incomes of families that have a mother who smokes.</li> 
<li>Finally, babies born to non-smoking mothers weigh about 1/2lb more at birth than those born to mothers 
who smoke.</li> 
</ul>

**Based on these results, would you feel comfortable calling the raw (unadjusted) differences in birthweight the "causal effect of smoking?" Why?**  
No, we would not be comfortable calling these differences the "causal effect of smoking" because 
we are still concerned about isolating the variation in the treatment (here, smoking or not smoking during pregnancy) 
from other factors that are correlated with both treatment status (smoking) and 
the outcome of interest (here, birthweight). For example, family income could be a confounder that affects
both the dependent and independent variables of interest.

Because of this, let's make a cross tabulation of the smoker dummy and the 
high income dummy including row percentages instead of frequencies. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
tab smoker highinc_dum, row nofreq
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
**What would you conclude from this cross-tab?**  
Among families where the mother smoked during pregnancy, almost 
68% had a family income below the median of the whole sample. This 
is quite different when compared to the group of families where the 
mother did not smoke during pregnancy. Among this group of mothers, 
only about 45% of the families had a family income below the median 
of the whole sample. 


## 3. Graph
To understand the underlying distribution of the variable that 
describes how many cigarettes mothers smoked while pregnant, 
we are going to make a histogram of the "cigs" variable. 
~~~~
<<dd_do>>

***We'll change the label of this variable first so 
***our histogram axis label makes more sense. 
lab var cigs "# Cigarettes/Day While Pregnant"
qui su cigs, det
hist cigs, freq addlabel ///
	title(Distribution of Cigarettes Smoked per Day While Pregnant) ///
	subtitle(Using Full Sample) ///
	xtitle("Number of Cigarettes per Day") ///
	ytitle("Number of Mothers") ///				
	start(0) ///
	width(5) ///
	xlabel(0(5)50) ///
	ylabel(0(300)1500, angle(horizontal)) ///
	text(1250 35 "Mean= `: di %6.1f r(mean)'", place(ne)) ///
	text(1190 35 "SD= `: di %6.1f r(sd)'", place(ne)) ///				
	fcolor(edkblue) lcolor(black) ///
	name("cigs_hist", replace)		
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
<<dd_graph: saving("cigs.hist.png") alt("hist cigs, freq") replace height(400)>>

**What observations do you have for this distribution?**  
Maybe people rounded in response to the survey? Cigs come 

Since the number of cigarettes associated with non-smokers 
makes the histogram hard to read for smokers, we are going to 
make a second histogram only including observations where 
"cigs!=0". 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
qui su cigs if cigs!=0, det
hist cigs if cigs!=0, freq addlabel ///
	title(Distribution of Cigarettes Smoked per Day While Pregnant) ///
	subtitle(Using Sub-Sample of Smokers) ///
	xtitle("Number of Cigarettes per Day") ///
	ytitle("Number of Mothers") ///				
	start(0) ///
	width(5) ///
	xlabel(0(5)50) ///
	ylabel(0(10)70, angle(horizontal)) ///
	text(60 35 "Mean= `: di %6.1f r(mean)'", place(ne)) ///
	text(57 35 "SD= `: di %6.1f r(sd)'", place(ne)) ///				
	fcolor(edkblue) lcolor(black) ///
	name("cigs_hist2", replace)		
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
<<dd_graph: saving("cigs.hist2.png") alt("hist cigs, freq") replace height(400)>>

We also want to make a histogram to see the distribution of the "parity" 
variable. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
lab var parity "Child's Birth Order"
hist parity, freq addlabel ///
	title(Distribution of Child's Birth Order) ///
 	xtitle("Birth Order Position") ///
	ytitle("Number of Children") ///				
	start(0) ///
	width(1) ///
	xlabel(1(1)6) ///
	ylabel(0(200)800, angle(horizontal)) ///
	fcolor(edkblue) lcolor(black) ///
	name("parity_hist", replace)			
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
<<dd_graph: saving("parity.hist.png") alt("hist parity, freq") replace height(400)>>

It will be helpful to create a single graph with two histograms 
comparing mother's education for smokers and non-smokers. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
forvalues i=0/1 {
hist motheduc if cigs!=`i', freq  ///
	title(Distribution of Mother's Education) ///
	subtitle(Among Smokers) ///
 	xtitle("Mother's Education in Years") ///
	ytitle("Number of Mothers") ///				
	start(0) ///
	width(5) ///
	xlabel(0(5)50) ///
	ylabel(0(300)1500, angle(horizontal)) ///
	text(825 6 "Mean= `: di %6.1f r(mean)'", place(ne)) ///
	text(750 6 "SD= `: di %6.1f r(sd)'", place(ne)) ///				
	fcolor(edkblue) lcolor(black) ///
	name("mothered_hist_cig`i'", replace)	
}			
<</dd_do>>
~~~~
<<dd_graph: saving("parity.hist.png") alt("hist parity, freq") replace height(400)>>
