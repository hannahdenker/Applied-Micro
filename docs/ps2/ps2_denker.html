<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to understand that each observation in this dataset represents a newborn.</p>
<h2><a href="#1-getting-started" id="1-getting-started">1. Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>In this section of code, I load the dataset and create a global to store key variables I want to know more about. I also make two new analytic variables&ndash; a dummy to represent whether or not the mother smoked, and a dummy to represent whether or not the newborn&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s income was above the median income in this sample.</p>
<p>I label these new variables and their values to keep their meanings clear in later analysis.</p>

<p>Looking at the dataset revelals some missingness in the &ldquo;fatheduc&rdquo; and motheduc variables. We can also see that the variables are stored in an appropriate format. It isn&rsquo;t obvious that there are any variables coded as negative for missing or that are top-coded, but the faminc variable might be top-cded as it tops out at $65,000.</p>

<h2><a href="#2-descriptive-statistics" id="2-descriptive-statistics">2. Descriptive Statistics</a></h2>
<p>We want to calculate descriptive statistics for variables that might help us answer our research question. I am going to use the <code>tabstat</code> command to make a table with the &ldquo;mean, median, standard deviation, and number of valid observations&rdquo; using the variables in the global &ldquo;desc_vars&rdquo; I created above.</p>

<p><strong>What do you notice in this table that you might want to report to your audience?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I notice from the results is that we are missing about 200 observations in the variable &ldquo;fatheduc&rdquo; and one observation in &ldquo;motheduc&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m noticing that the mean and median are relatively close for the &ldquo;bwght&rdquo; variables, which makes me think that this variable is distributed normally.</p>
<p>While the previously mentioned points are important to me, the researcher, I&rsquo;m not sure I would report them to my audience. Usually, we like to share demographics with our audience, so I think making a table with the means of the &ldquo;bwght&rdquo;, &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;white&rdquo; variables would help our audience understand the newborns in this sample.</p>
<p>I would also point out that most of the parents in this sample have at least a high school degree. Finally, it&rsquo;s helpful to share basic means e.g. 78% of the sample is white and the mean family income is about $29,000.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to create a new table of descriptive statistics that separates smokers from the non-smokers in our sample. We will use the <code>by</code> option to accomplish this with the <code>tabstat</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>. sort smoker

. tabstat $desc_vars, c(s) statistics(mean median sd count) by(smoker) longstub

<p><strong>Are there substantial differences in the characteristics of smokers and non-smokers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a substantial difference in the number of observations between the two groups (about
1200 newborns were born to mothers who didn't smoke and about 200 newborns were born to mothers 
who did smoke).</li> 
<li>Parents that included a mother who smoked were slightly less likely to have graduated 
high school, and parents that included a mother who did not smoke were slightly more likely to have some 
education after high school.</li> 
<li>Importantly, the family income of parents that include non-smoking mothers is about $10,000 more
dollars than the incomes of families that have a mother who smokes.</li> 
<li>Finally, babies born to non-smoking mothers weigh about 1/2lb more at birth than those born to mothers 
who smoke.</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Based on these results, would you feel comfortable calling the raw (unadjusted) differences in birthweight the &ldquo;causal effect of smoking?&rdquo; Why?</strong><br />
No, we would not be comfortable calling these differences the &ldquo;causal effect of smoking&rdquo; because we are still concerned about isolating the variation in the treatment (here, smoking or not smoking during pregnancy) from other factors that are correlated with both treatment status (smoking) and the outcome of interest (here, birthweight). For example, family income could be a confounder that affects both the dependent and independent variables of interest that we would want to control for in a model estimating the relationship between smoking and birthweight. There are probably other omitted variables that we would want to include in our model so that our estimates of the relationship of interest is not biased.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a cross tabulation of the smoker dummy and the high income dummy including row percentages instead of frequencies.</p>
<pre><code>. tab smoker highinc_dum, row nofreq

                 | dum: =1 if family inc
  dum: =1 if mom |     above median
   smoked at all | 0= FamInc  1= FamInc |     Total
-----------------+----------------------+----------
0= Mom d/n Smoke |     45.32      54.68 |    100.00 
   1= Mom Smoked |     67.92      32.08 |    100.00 
-----------------+----------------------+----------
           Total |     48.78      51.22 |    100.00 

</code></pre>
<p><strong>What would you conclude from this cross-tab?</strong><br />
Among families where the mother smoked during pregnancy, almost 68% had a family income below the median of the whole sample. This is quite different when compared to the group of families where the mother did not smoke during pregnancy. Among this group of mothers, only about 45% of the families had a family income below the median of the whole sample.</p>

Most mothers in our sample did not smoke while pregant. Those that did, mostly smoked less than 25 cigarettes (or about a pack or less) a day.</p>

<p><strong>What differences, if any, do you notice in these two distributions?</strong><br />
It is most common in both groups to have 12 years of education (finish high school). We can see that is is more likely for mothers in the non-smoking group. Additionally, it appears that smoking while pregnant is also associated with completing less than a high school education.</p>

<p><strong>What do you notice about these data?</strong><br />
We can see that there is a weak negative association betwen birthweight and the number of cigarettes smoked per day while pregnant. We can see that there are not many mothers who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day while pregnant and that the data for cigarettes per day takes on discrete values.</p>

<p>To understand the relationship between birthweight and a mother&rsquo;s smoking habits, we will regress birthweight onto the number of cigarettes smoked per day and control for some key demographic variables that might be related to both a baby&rsquo;s birthweight and its mother&rsquo;s smoking habits. To keep the sample consistent across models, we will drop observations with missing data in one of the covariates (motheduc).</p>

<p><strong>Write a summary of what you would conclude based on this entire table of results.</strong></p>
<p>These regressions model the association between the number of cigarettes a mother smoked per day during pregnancy and the birth weight of an infant. Across models, we see that the sign and significance of the coefficient on the cigarettes/Day variable are consistent. We would expect to see a negative .46 - .51 difference in birthweight (measured in ounces) for every additional cigarette a mother smoked during pregnancy, on average. We can reject the null hypothesis that cigarette smoking during pregnancy is not related to birthweight at the p &lt; 0.001 level in all models.</p>
<p>When we control for family income, we see that cigarette smoking is still negatively associated with birthweight and that a $1,000 positive difference in family income is associated with a .09 increase in birthweight among mothers who have the same smoking habits. This estimate is statistically significant at the p&lt;0.01 level.</p>
<p>Our third model includes more variables that we might consider potential confounders in our attempts to estimate the effect of smoking on birthweight. We have controlled for birth order (parity), baby gender, race, and the mother&rsquo;s education. Holding each of these constant, we see that cigarette smoking during pregnancy and birth weight is still statistically and negatively associated with birthweight. However, the addition of the child-level controls with mother&rsquo;s education have resulted in the coefficient on the &ldquo;family income&rdquo; variable no longer being statistically significant. This might be due to including the mother&rsquo;s education variable (also non-significant) because together these two variables are attempting to explain the same part of the variation and their overlap results in neither being a significant predictor of the outcome.</p>
<p>Additionally, we see that the coefficients on the child-level controls (parity, male, and white) are all statistically significant and positive. On average, we see that white children are associated with about 5.7 more ounces in birthweight than non-white children; children born male are typically about 3.2 ounces heavier than females at birth, and every one-unit positive difference in birth order is associated with 1.8 more ounces in birthweight holding all other variables constant.</p>
<p>The intercepts here tell us the average birthweight of a child (in ounces) when the controls in each model are equal to zero. So in model 1, the intercept represents the average birthweight of children born to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. The intercept in models 2 and 3 make less sense because we would not expect a family&rsquo;s income to be $0 or for a mother to have 0 years of education.</p>
